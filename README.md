# ðŸš— License Plate Detection & Recognition

A deep learning project for **automatic license plate detection and recognition**, using computer vision techniques. This project processes images of vehicles to identify and extract license plates, followed by character recognition to decode the plate number.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
- âœ… **License Plate Detection**: Identifies and localizes the license plate in an image.  
- âœ… **License Plate Recognition**: Extracts and reads the text from detected plates.  
- âœ… **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes the dataset, bounding box sizes, character distribution, and visualizes samples.  
- âœ… **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implements deep learning-based YOLO and OCR models.
